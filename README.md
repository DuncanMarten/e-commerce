  ## Description
  This application sets up a database for an e-commerce website. The database includes tables of categories, tags, and products that the company can add, update, delete, and view from.  There are api routes for all those actions associated with each table.  All that the user needs to add is a front-end that uses the endpoints and they will have a working e-commerce webpage.

  ## Installation
  To install this application all the user needs to do is clone the code from my github and install the npms.  As well the user should add a .env file with their database name, MySQL username, and password so they can utilize the application.  Finally go into the MySQL command line and source the schema to set up the database on their pc. View this video if you want a visual of how to run the application.

  ## Usage
  After setting up the database, the user can seed the database if they want to see it in action.  Otherwise just start up the application with npm start and add some categories, tags, and products and they will have a loaded database to work with.  If you have not made a front end for this application use Insomnia to test and view the database information.
